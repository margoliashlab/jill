I read the JACK API online and follow the instruction on http://dis-dot-dat.net/index.cgi?item=jacktuts/starting/.

The metro.c is given by the JACK sample code. I use it to generate beep.

The simple_client.c is also given by JACK sample code. 
Originally, this is used to deliver data from input port to output port.

The only change I made is in the function “process”, which randomly multiplies each sample by -1.


compile the two files:
gcc -o beep `pkg-config --cflags --libs jack` metro.c
gcc -o simple `pkg-config --cflags --libs jack` simple_client.c

run:
./beep -b 120
./simple random

connect ports:
WeitiandeMacBook-Pro:~ lwt$ jack_lsp
system:capture_1
system:capture_2
system:playback_1
system:playback_2
metro:120_bpm
random:input
random:output
WeitiandeMacBook-Pro:~ lwt$ jack_connect metro:120_bpm system:playback_1

Now you can hear “beep”

WeitiandeMacBook-Pro:~ lwt$ jack_connect metro:120_bpm random:input

Now you can hear distorted “beep”.

I hope what I did is correct. For the JILL, I have already read it a whole day. But this is not that easy to understand at once.
